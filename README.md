# 📦 Decentralized Reputation System

## 📜 Project Description

This smart contract powers a decentralized application (dApp) on the Stellar blockchain that enables users to lease physical or digital assets in exchange for Lumens (XLM). It introduces a built-in **Reputation System** that rewards or penalizes users based on their behavior—such as timely asset returns or disputes.

All actions are enforced through smart contracts, ensuring automation, transparency, and trustless interactions between asset owners and lessees.

## 🌍 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to enable:

- **Trust-based asset leasing** without intermediaries.
- **Incentivized user behavior** using on-chain reputation.
- **Automated lease lifecycle management**, including returns, payments, and disputes.
- A **fully decentralized platform** for individuals and businesses to lease or rent out digital or physical assets globally.
